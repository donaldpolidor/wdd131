                <h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1>
                <p>Donald Polidor, known by his artist name Donald Graffiti, was born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and grew
                    up in a residential area of the capital where he still resides today. From the age of 7, he had a
                    deep love of art and never stopped drawing, his passion already ingrained in him.
                </p>
                <p>After completing his secondary education at three different schools and passing his Baccalaureate II,
                    he went on to study computer science at a vocational school, where he devoted himself devoutly until
                    graduation. He subsequently landed his first job and is currently continuing his online studies at
                    Brigham Young University (BYU) in the USA, preparing to obtain a Bachelor's degree in web
                    programming.</p>
                <p>Despite all those years of study, he never stopped drawing, seeing it as a refuge. He liked to show
                    his creations to his friends to get their impressions. As time went by and he progressed in the
                    field, he had the opportunity to meet Lesly Jean Baptiste NOULA, a great local artist, known for his
                    diversified practice including painting, theater, dance, slam and sculpture. This meeting was
                    pivotal, with Lesly Jean Baptiste becoming a mentor and father figure to Donald, helping him to
                    further hone his craft. </p>
                <p>For several years, between 2011 and 2016, Donald also practiced theater, participating in various
                    cultural activities. In 2021, with the support of his mentor Lesly Jean Baptiste NOULA and another
                    artist, he planned and worked intensively for eight months to organize a major exhibition of pencil
                    portraits. The initiative proved a great success and enriched his artistic experience.
                    and is currently teaching drawing techniques at a vocational school in the capital.</p>
                <p>Donald continues to evolve in the field of art, producing numerous works in his own
                    home studio, which also bears his artist's name, "DONALD GRAFFITI".</p>
